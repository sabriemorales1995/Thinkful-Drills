>>>What is scope? Your explanation should include the idea of global vs. local scope.
Scope is the view the browser has of a variable. 
If a variable has been defined outside of any function block, it is considered in global view since there is no function relative to it. 
Otherwise, the view is considered a local scope.
A variable that is defined in a parent function can be called in a child function and still be considered local scope. 
To find the variable in question, no matter how many parent functions the scope expands to, it will still be considered in local scope. 

>>Why are global variables avoided?
Since global variables can be easily accessed by any function, its value can also be changed by any function as well. 
Being exposed without limitations can lead to unwanted results.

>>>Explain JavaScript's strict mode
Strict mode is put in place at the top of the file, or the preferred function, 
to ensure that all variables have been created with let or const.

>>>What are side effects, and what is a pure function?
Side effects are results of global variables that produce irregular outputs causing a function to be labeled as indeterminate.
A pure function is one where its code is consistent with results and does exactly as expected.
